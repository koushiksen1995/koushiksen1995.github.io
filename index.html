								I work on various aspects of massive binary evolution discussed below. 
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								<b>Algol binary stars</b>
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								The term "Algol" addresses its prototypical star Beta Persei, a bright multiple star system in 
								the Perseus constellation. It is one of the first stars recorded to 
								show a variation in its brightness, dating back to 1244--1163 B.C. 
								<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> For all Batman enthusiasts, 
								the word "Algol" is derived from the Arabic word "Ra's al-Ghul", or the head of the Demon. For a 
								more extensive historical background, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol" 
								target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page. 
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								These systems have short orbital periods (a few days) and can, more often than not, be observable as 
								double-lined eclipsing binaries. Hence, they are ideal systems for studying stellar and binary properties 
								as precise measurements of their component masses, radii, and effective temperatures are possible. 
								Moreover, they constitute a long-lived phase of close binary evolution where we see the systems in a 
								unique configuration where the less massive star transfers mass to its more massive companion. 
								More than 50 massive Algol binaries have been observed across our Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud 
								and Small Magellanic Cloud combined. 
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								The above properties of Algol binaries provide a unique test-bed to study our theories of massive 
								stellar and binary evolution, such as the physics of binary interaction directly. I study the 
								evolution of massive Algol binaries (Algols heavier the eight times the mass of the Sun) 
								using detailed binary evolution models computed using the software 
								<a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/" target="_blank">MESA</a> (Modules for 
								Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). By directly comparing the predictions of the binary models 
								to the observed properties of the massive Algols, I derive constraints on binary and stellar 
								physics, such as mass transfer efficiency, internal mixing, stellar winds, etc. </span>

								<b>Wolf-Rayet stars</b>
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								Wolf-Rayet stars are the brighest and hottest stars observable in the sky. The spectra of these 
								stars show broad emission lines of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen and/or carbon. They 
								give out strong radiation-driven winds, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">enriching the interstellar medium with various heavy 
								elements. While most Wolf-Rayet stars are expected to burning helium in their cores, there 
								is also a handful of them situated on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, 
								presumably thought to be burning hydrogen in their cores. These stars are thought to be the 
								direct progenitors of black holes and neutron stars! So, an understanding of the formation 
								and evolution of these systems directly refine our knowledge in the field of gravitational 
								wave astronomy, a blooming new field in recent times. 
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								I have shown that the evolution of very massive binaries challenges the convention knowledge 
								of binary evolution, all related to the luminosity of these stars being close to their Eddington 
								luminosity. Observed counterparts have been identified confirming the existence of the novel 
								binary evolution channel where a more massive star can transfer mass to a less massive star at 
								the nuclear timescale (reverse Algols). Furthermore, the mass-donors can be observable as 
								Wolf-Rayet stars, with BAT99 #113 being the smoking gun. I am studying the observable properties 
								of this class of binaries to understand their impact on the formation of black holes and in turn, 
								the strongest sources of gravitational wave emission. </span>
